This was my first problem ever in Machine Learning and Data Science and I wanted to do something that can have impact on the world out there.
I got an inspiration from this article https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/09/8-ml-ai-projects-stand-out.html and I wanted to do something about mental health of people around the world.
With little to no experience about deep learning and Machine Learning, I wanted to solve problems and bring an impact to the world.
The core machine learning application for this project is Sentimental Analysis.
The traditional approaches of Mental health diagnosis involved going to a spsychologist and having them determine if you have a problem.
The key here is that a psychologist will use the words from your mouth or the ones you wrote to determine if you have mental health  issues.
Such a procedure can be expensive, slow and is rarely an option as most people never realize about their condition fast enough to warrant visiting the psychologist.
But even when they did, it is often too late. 
Most often, people commit suicide due to mental health issues.

The solution:
  Hypotheis here is that analysis of lingustic markers in social web can help an individual know the state of their mental health fare earlier than when he/she was to rely on traditional approach.
  The second thing is that such a method is also far cheaper than the taditional alternative.
Procedure.
  Deep Learning + Sentimental Analysis.
